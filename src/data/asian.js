      "Spicy, aromatic and exotic… Thai curries. Im ready for a big bowl any time of the day. Todays Thai Shrimp Curry is a very special recipe that I have been cooking for years.        You can make it as an authentic, hot curry one would get on the streets of Bangkok, or customize the heat a little to suite your palate. At the end, its all about that distinct combination of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy in a bowl, which Thai food is so famously known for.",
